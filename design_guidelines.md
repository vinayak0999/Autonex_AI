# Autonex AI Industrial Automation - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**System-Based Approach**: Utilizing modern design system principles focused on industrial technology and AI. Drawing inspiration from enterprise-grade platforms like Linear and Notion for clean, professional aesthetics while incorporating industrial visual elements.

## Core Design Elements

### A. Color Palette
**Primary Colors:**
- Dark Navy: 220 25% 15% (main brand color)
- Electric Blue: 210 80% 50% (AI/tech accent)
- Industrial Orange: 25 85% 55% (warning/action states)

**Supporting Colors:**
- Light backgrounds: 220 15% 97%
- Medium gray: 220 10% 60%
- Dark text: 220 20% 20%
- Success green: 145 70% 45%

### B. Typography
**Primary Font**: Inter (Google Fonts) - clean, modern sans-serif
**Headings**: Bold weights (600-700) for strong hierarchy
**Body**: Regular (400) and medium (500) weights
**Code/Technical**: JetBrains Mono for any technical specifications

### C. Layout System
**Spacing Units**: Tailwind spacing of 4, 8, 12, and 16 (p-4, m-8, gap-12, etc.)
**Container**: max-width-7xl with responsive padding
**Grid**: 12-column responsive grid system

### D. Component Library

**Navigation**: Fixed header with blur background, clean typography
**Hero Section**: Full-viewport height with industrial imagery overlay
**Cards**: Elevated shadows, rounded corners (rounded-lg), hover states
**Buttons**: Primary (solid blue), secondary (outline), and ghost variants
**Forms**: Clean inputs with subtle borders, focus states with blue accent
**Icons**: Heroicons for consistency, industrial/AI-themed where appropriate

### E. Visual Treatment

**Industrial Theme**: 
- Subtle grid overlays and technical line patterns
- Geometric shapes suggesting manufacturing precision
- Dashboard-style elements for monitoring sections

**Gradients**: 
- Hero background: Dark navy to deep blue gradient
- Card overlays: Subtle blue-to-transparent gradients
- Section dividers: Light gray gradients for separation

**Modern Effects**:
- Subtle blur backgrounds for floating elements
- Clean shadows (shadow-lg, shadow-xl)
- Smooth transitions (transition-all duration-300)

## Images Section

**Hero Image**: Large background image of modern industrial facility with AI/digital overlay effects (manufacturing floor, robotic systems, or digital twin visualization)

**Dashboard Mockup**: Screenshot of AI monitoring dashboard showing real-time data, charts, and alerts

**Industry Icons**: Clean, minimalist icons for packaging, plastics, and general manufacturing

**Process Illustrations**: Simple vector graphics showing material flow, quality checks, and automation processes

## Key Design Principles

1. **Professional Industrial Aesthetic**: Clean, technical feeling that instills confidence
2. **Information Hierarchy**: Clear section breaks with strong typography hierarchy
3. **Trust & Reliability**: Conservative color use with professional spacing
4. **Interactive Elements**: Subtle hover states and smooth transitions
5. **Mobile-First**: Responsive design ensuring excellent mobile experience
6. **Performance**: Optimized loading with efficient asset usage

## Section-Specific Guidelines

**Hero**: Dark overlay on industrial image, centered content, strong CTA
**Vision**: Three-column card layout with icons and descriptions
**Services**: Grid layout with hover effects revealing more details
**Industries**: Interactive cards with industry-specific imagery and statistics
**Contact**: Clean form design with validation states and professional styling
